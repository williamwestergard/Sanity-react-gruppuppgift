    "description": "Aardonyx is known from two immature individuals. Adults would have been much larger, probably over 10m.Aardonyx would have been largely bipedal (walking on two legs) but also capable of walking on all four legs. This and its way of feeding are transitional features between those of basal sauropodomorphs and the more derived sauropods (large dinosaurs that walked on all fours) that came later.",

    "description": "Abelisaurus was a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, about 85 to 80 million years ago.  It was discovered in Patagonia, Argentina, and is known from a partial skull found in the Allen Formation. Abelisaurus was a member of the Abelisauridae family, a group of carnivorous dinosaurs that were prevalent in the southern continents of Gondwana. It likely measured around 7 to 9 meters (23 to 30 feet) in length, though exact size estimates vary due to the fragmentary fossil remains. Unlike other theropods, abelisaurids had short, deep skulls and extremely reduced forelimbs, possibly even more so than those of Tyrannosaurus rex. Abelisaurus is thought to have been a top predator in its ecosystem, preying on smaller dinosaurs and possibly scavenging as well.",

    "period": "Late Jurassic",
    "found_in": "USAAllosaurus was a large meat-eating dinosaur that lived in prehistoric North America. It had three-fingered hands and distinctive horns above its eyes. Saurophaganax, a related dinosaur, was once thought to be a larger cousin of Allosaurus. But recent research has shown that Saurophaganax was probably named by mistake, and many of the bones actually belonged to Allosaurus.Was Allosaurus a pack hunter?Multiple Allosaurus specimens have been discovered together in the same bone beds, causing some researchers to wonder if Allosaurus may have hunted in packs.However, there may be other reasons for the grouped fossils. Some Allosaurus remains have been found with possible evidence of bite marks from other Allosaurus, suggesting they may have attacked one another.Nobody can say for sure whether individual Allosaurus cooperated with one another, but itâs likely they sometimes competed and fought.Was Allosaurus related to Tyrannosaurus?While Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus looked similar â both were large, two-legged carnivores â they werenât closely related.Allosaurus lived during the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, whereas Tyrannosaurus lived many millions of years later during the Late Cretaceous â around 66 million years ago.But both would have been top of the food chain during their respective time periods. Why did Allosaurus have horns?No one knows for sure why Allosaurus had small horns on its skull. There are several possibilities.The horns might have been used for species recognition â in other words, to help Allosaurus recognise other Allosaurus. Itâs also possible male and female Allosaurus may have had differently sized or coloured horns, perhaps as a mating display.Some experts think the horns might have helped protect their eyes from sunlight. Some modern animals, such as eagles, have ridges above their eyes for this reason.Itâs also possible the horns played a role in protecting the skull during fights with other Allosaurus if they took part in headbutting or snout-pushing contests. But the horns probably werenât strong enough to withstand direct, full-power combat.Allosaurus and SaurophaganaxSince the 1930s, scientists had thought that a collection of fossils from Oklahoma, USA, belonged to a larger relative of Allosaurus that eventually came to be called Saurophaganax.However, some experts werenât convinced. Some of the bones looked like they could belong to Allosaurus â and some of them might not even belong a meat-eating dinosaur at all.Recently it was decided that some of the bones should be renamed to belong to a new species of Allosaurus â Allosaurus anax.The rest of the remains are too fragmentary to say for sure what they belong to. They might even be from a plant-eating sauropod dinosaur, such as Diplodocus.What did Allosaurus prey on?Allosaurus hunted many of the plant-eating dinosaurs that shared its environment in the Late Jurassic Period.Researchers have found Stegosaurus fossils showing Allosaurus bite marks, and thereâs also evidence of Allosaurus scavenging large sauropod remains. Experts arenât sure if Allosaurus would have attacked very large herbivorous dinosaurs while they were alive or mostly fed on them after they were already dead.Itâs possible Allosaurus was a flesh grazer â meaning it may have bitten meat from large dinosaurs without killing them, allowing the prey dinosaur to survive and heal.",

    "length": "0.6m",
    "diet": "carnivorousTeeth: many small, curved teethFood:small lizards and fish",
    "period": "Late Jurassic",
    "found_in": "ChinaAnchiornis was a crow-sized, feathered dinosaur that lived in prehistoric Asia. Curved claws may have helped it to climb trees.It had wing feathers on its arms and back legs, and some experts consider it a four-winged dinosaur. But it probably didnât use the back wings for much in the air.Could Anchiornis fly?Anchiornis had smaller wings than some other feathered dinosaurs that lived at a similar time, such as Archaeopteryx. As such, it may not have been capable of powered flight, also called true flight, which involved flapping wings. Instead, it may have simply glided from one spot to another.What did Anchiornis eat?The remains of lizard bones and fish scales have been found with Anchiornis fossils.These remnants were found inside gastric pellets â lumps of hard-to-digest matter such as bones, feathers and claws. Many modern birds form these in their stomachs after eating and then throw them up later.So far, Anchiornis is the earliest bird relative known to have made these pellets.What colour was Anchiornis?Itâs unusual for scientists to be able to tell the colour of any part of a dinosaur.Remarkably, some Anchiornis fossils are so well preserved that experts have been able to recover pigments from multiple places around the body.In one study, researchers discovered that Anchiornis was mostly black and grey, with a crest of red-brown feathers on its head and brown speckles on its face.Another team looked at pigments in a different Anchiornis specimen as a follow-up. They found that although this one was also black and grey all over, it didnât seem to have the red-brown colours on its head.There are a few different theories for the colour differences. Perhaps the red-brown parts just didnât preserve properly in the second specimen. Or maybe there were colour differences between different types of Anchiornis.The specimen used in the first colour study was also a bit smaller than the second one. So, perhaps one of the specimens was male and the other female. Modern birds often have colour differences like this. Another idea is that younger Anchiornis may have had the red-brown colour and lost it as they grew older.Was Anchiornis a bird?Anchiornis was a very close relative of early birds, but it wasnât a bird itself.Ever since the discovery of Anchiornis, scientists have debated where it should sit on the evolutionary tree. Originally, people thought it was a direct ancestor of birds â perhaps the earliest bird known to science. But later studies have shown that it was more like a cousin to the bird family line. Anchiornis lived at a time when dinosaurs were evolving into birds. It had many bird-like features, such as feathers and wings. This makes Anchiornis an important part of the story of how birds came to be. It shows us that many traits we associate with birds were already developing in some dinosaurs before true birds appeared.",

    "found_in": "Canada, USAAnkylosaurus lived during the Late Cretaceous Period in what is now North America. This armoured dinosaur had bony plates covering its body and a heavy club at the end of its tail.Though it's the most famous member of the ankylosaur group, it's not the best understood. Scientists still haven't found an entire Ankylosaurus skeleton. Some other types of ankylosaurs, such as Zuul, are known from many more bones.But we do have enough Ankylosaurus remains to see that it may have been one of the biggest ankylosaurs.When was Ankylosaurus discovered?The first Ankylosaurus bones were found in 1906 at the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, USA. Barnum Brown led the fossil hunting trip - the same scientist who led the discovery of Tyrannosaurus rex a few years earlier.These Ankylosaurus fossils weren't very complete. The distinctive tail club wasn't discovered until much later.Barnum and his team found several pieces of armour, but they had separated from the main skeleton. Even today, nobody knows exactly how Ankylosaurus' back armour should be arranged.Was Ankylosaurus aggressive?We can't say for sure how any dinosaur behaved when it was alive. Scientists can only go on fossils and comparisons with living animals.We know that as a plant eater, Ankylosaurus wouldn't have used its tail club to attack prey. It probably used the club to defend itself against big predators.Being herbivorous doesn't mean Ankylosaurus was harmless. Many modern plant-eating animals, such as elephants and hippos, can be very aggressive and dangerous. We may never know whether Ankylosaurus was gentle in nature!How did Ankylosaurus move?This hefty dinosaur probably moved very slowly most of the time, although it might have been able to move faster when needed.Ankylosaurus probably couldn't move its tail club up and down much, but could swing it powerfully from side to side - delivering devastating swipes to any would-be predators.What did Ankylosaurus eat?Experts think Ankylosaurus grazed on low-growing plants. It probably wasn't picky - eating many kinds of ferns, shrubs and fruit.Ankylosaurus would've needed to eat around 60 kilogrammes of plant matter a day. That's about the same as a modern elephant.Some scientists think Ankylosaurus might have been able to use its front limbs for digging. If so, perhaps it also ate roots and any other kinds of plant and animal matter it could dig up.Were there any ankylosaurs without tail clubs?Several members of the ankylosaur group lacked the bony tail clubs seen in Ankylosaurus and others such as Tarchia, but were otherwise still covered in armour.These clubless ankylosaurs include Nodosaurus, Panoplosaurus and the British dinosaur Polacanthus.",

    "found_in": "USAApatosaurus was a large sauropod dinosaur. It lived around 150 million years ago in the Late Jurassic Period, in an area that is now North America.Like all sauropods, Apatosaurus ate plants.Young Apatosaurus individuals grew up quickly. They took around 10 years to reach full adult size.Where did Apatosaurus live?Apatosaurus lived alongside Stegosaurus, Diplodocus and Allosaurus.Their fossils were found in the Morrison Formation, a sequence of rocks that covers a huge area spanning several US states, including Wyoming, Colorado and Montana. Many dinosaurs have been discovered there.During the Late Jurassic the environment was semi-arid, with forests, rivers and floodplains. There were distinct wet and dry seasons.How did Apatosaurus defend itself from predators?Apatosaurus had a long, narrow tail that it might have used as a whip.The animal's huge size would also have helped to protect it from smaller predators, which may have found Apatosaurus too big to take on. Living in herds gave extra protection.What does Apatosaurus mean?The name Apatosaurus comes from Greek words meaning 'deceptive lizard'. The scientist who named this dinosaur, Othniel Charles Marsh, felt that some of the fossil bones were confusing to identify. They seemed to resemble the bones of a sea reptile.Are Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus the same dinosaur?For more than 100 years, most scientists stopped using the well-known dinosaur name Brontosaurus. They thought that Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus fossils were the same thing.But based on a study done in 2015, experts now think that the two dinosaurs are separate after all, although they are closely related.When did Apatosaurus go extinct?Apatosaurus went extinct 145 million years ago, at the end of the Jurassic Period.",

    "period": "Late Jurassic",
    "found_in": "GermanyArchaeopteryx was a small, bird-like dinosaur. It lived during the Late Jurassic Period in what is now Europe.The discovery of the first Archaeopteryx fossil in Germany in 1861 caused a lot of confusion. No birds were known from so far back. Some people even thought it might be an angel.Since then, multiple fossils of Archaeopteryx have been discovered. Many show clear evidence of long feathers. But we don't know whether Archaeopteryx was fully able to fly or if it could only glide.Archaeopteryx also has a common name - Urvogel, a German name meaning 'primeval bird'.Is Archaeopteryx a bird or a dinosaur?Strictly speaking, all birds are dinosaurs. But not all dinosaurs are birds. Scientists sometimes use the term 'non-avian dinosaurs' when talking about prehistoric dinosaurs that aren't birds.The line between bird and non-avian dinosaur can be vague, and many experts have discussed which way to class Archaeopteryx. For many years, scientists spoke about it as an ancient bird. These days, many people believe it should be called a dinosaur.Ultimately, categories like bird and non-avian dinosaur are invented by humans. The natural world doesn't always fit neatly into them. Animals such as Archaeopteryx that could sit across two or more categories are sometimes called transitional fossils.While Archaeopteryx is sometimes called the first bird or the earliest bird, scientists now think that there could be even older bird ancestors. Dinosaurs such as Anchiornis and Aurornis might sit even further back on the bird branch of the dinosaur family tree. If so, they're even earlier relatives of true birds. It's very difficult to say for sure.Find out about the earliest birds and their evolution >How similar was Archaeopteryx to modern birds?Archaeopteryx had some features in common with the birds of today. It had broad feathered wings and a small body, roughly the size of a magpie.After comparing its eyes to those of modern birds and reptiles, experts concluded that Archaeopteryx was probably diurnal. This means that it would have been active during the day and slept at night, like many of today's birds.We don't know whether Archaeopteryx mostly lived on the ground or in trees. Some scientists think it might have been equally comfortable with either, like a crow.Unlike modern birds, however, Archaeopteryx had sharp teeth and a long, bony tail.Where have Archaeopteryx fossils been found?Many specimens of Archaeopteryx have been recovered over the years. All are from the limestone quarries near Solnhofen in Germany.In the Jurassic Period, this area was a lagoon surrounded by sub-tropical islands. Other small creatures such as insects and lizards - which Archaeopteryx may have preyed on - have been unearthed there too. So have some pterosaurs - flying reptiles - and the small dinosaur Compsognathus.The first Archaeopteryx fossil ever found was a single feather.Later, full skeletons were discovered showing feather impressions. We bought the first of these in 1862. It is now known as 'the London specimen' and is on display in our Cadogan gallery.There has since been debate over whether the first feather discovered really belongs to Archaeopteryx.Why is Archaeopteryx important?Two years before the discovery of Archaeopteryx, Charles Darwin had just written On the Origin of Species. The book was the first to lay out the theory of evolution.Many people back then - scientists included - strongly disagreed with Darwin's concept and claimed that it wasn't possible for animals to evolve over time. But the discovery of the Archaeopteryx fossils, clearly showing a feathered and bird-like dinosaur, seemed to prove that dinosaurs had evolved into birds.Even 100 years later, there were still those who didn't accept it. Some people published articles claiming that the feathers must be fake. The controversy didn't last long, however, as our scientists were able to show that the fossils were real.The discovery of Archaeopteryx was a landmark moment for dinosaur scientists, and it is still considered to be one of the most important finds in history.What colour was Archaeopteryx?It's usually almost impossible for scientists to know what colour a dinosaur would have been in life.But thanks to modern scanning technology, experts have been able to find out the colour of one Archaeopteryx wing feather - which seems to have been jet-black.We don't know whether Archaeopteryx was black all over or only on its wings.",

They were all titanosaurs, a type of sauropod.Argentinosaurus probably used its long neck to sweep the ground or to reach high up in search of vegetation. The hatchlings of Argentinosaurus would have taken 15 years to grow to adulthood and in that time they would have been very vulnerable to predators, such as Giganotosaurus.",

So far, we only have remains for the front parts of its jaws and some teeth.We can only guess at what the full dinosaur might have looked like based on what we know about other dromaeosaurs.When was Atrociraptor discovered?A fossil hunter named Wayne Marshall discovered Atrociraptor's jaw fossil in 1995 in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada.But it wasn't until nine years later, in 2004, that scientists studied the remains and gave the dinosaur its name.How big was Atrociraptor?Given that we don't have much Atrociraptor fossil material to look at, it's hard to say how big the full dinosaur was.Experts estimate it was similar in stature to the turkey-sized Velociraptor. But this may change if we find more fossils.Did Atrociraptor have feathers?As we've only found jaw and tooth remains for Atrociraptor, there's not yet any direct evidence that this dinosaur had feathers.But as far as we know, all other dromaeosaurs had feathers. So Atrociraptor probably did too.",

    "period": "Late Jurassic",
    "found_in": "USABrachiosaurus was a very tall plant-eating dinosaur that lived in prehistoric North America.We donât have a complete skeleton for Brachiosaurus. Most full-body reconstructions of Brachiosaurus are based on the related African dinosaur Giraffatitan.At one time, the dinosaur now known as Giraffatitan was believed to be a species of Brachiosaurus. These days, scientists think they were two distinct species.When was Brachiosaurus discovered?The first Brachiosaurus remains were found in Colorado, USA, in 1900.They were unearthed by Elmer S Riggs, a scientist from Chicago. To begin with, Elmer thought heâd found a Brontosaurus, but soon realised this dinosaur must have been much bigger.It wasnât until 1903 that Elmer named his find Brachiosaurus. At the time, it was the largest dinosaur ever discovered. What did Brachiosaurus eat?Experts think Brachiosaurus fed on leaves from tall trees, such as conifers and tree ferns.Brachiosaurus couldnât chew, so it swallowed the vegetation whole.It digested the tough leaves using a process called hindgut fermentation. Instead of breaking down food in its stomach, Brachiosaurus had a special area in its intestines where tiny bacteria helped break down the plant matter.Some modern plant-eating animals, such as horses, elephants and rabbits, also use hindgut fermentation to digest their food.Which was bigger, Brachiosaurus or Argentinosaurus?While Brachiosaurus was a very large dinosaur, Argentinosaurus was even bigger.Brachiosaurus was around 22 metres long, while Argentinosaurus could reach 35 metres in length. At 80,000 kilogrammes, Argentinosaurus was also much heavier than Brachiosaurus, which weighed 46,900 kilogrammes.However, some experts think the Brachiosaurus fossils were from an individual that wasnât fully grown. Brachiosaurus might have been a bit larger than our current estimates â but it still probably didnât reach the colossal size of Argentinosaurus.Why was Brachiosaurus given a name that means arm lizard?Brachiosaurusâ front legs â its âarmsâ â were longer than its back legs.This gave the dinosaur a distinctive upward-tilted body posture, which â along with its long neck â made Brachiosaurus very well adapted for feeding on tall trees.Are Brachiosaurus and Brontosaurus the same?Brachiosaurus and Brontosaurus lived at the same time and in the same environment. They shared some similarities â both were very large plant eaters that walked on four legs and had long necks.But Brachiosaurus was much taller than Brontosaurus, which ate ground-level vegetation.",

    "found_in": "Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, North AfricaCarcharodontosaurus was a very large meat-eating dinosaur.It is named after Carcharodon, the scientific name for several types of shark - of which the great white shark is the only living example.Carcharodontosaurus teeth look a lot like shark teeth. Like Tyrannosaurus, it had about 60 of them.Where did Carcharodontosaurus live?Carcharodontosaurus fossils have been found across North Africa in Algeria, Egypt and Morocco.In the Late Cretaceous, this region was warm and humid with rainforests, rivers and lakes.Carcharodontosaurus lived alongside many other dinosaurs, including sauropods such as Paralititan and Rebbachisaurus and the theropods Spinosaurus and Deltadromeus.What did Carcharodontosaurus eat?Scientists aren't sure what Carcharodontosaurus ate. It most likely fed on large prey such as plant-eating dinosaurs.Carcharodontosaurus had a much less powerful bite than Tyrannosaurus and more fragile teeth. But while it probably didn't crush bones, its teeth were suited to ripping flesh.How big was Carcharodontosaurus?Carcharodontosaurus is one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs known. At one point, scientists thought its skull might be the longest ever found. It was around 1.6 metres in length.The full animal could reach lengths of at least 12.5 metres - a size comparable to Tyrannosaurus.Giganotosaurus may have been even larger than both dinosaurs. A lack of complete remains makes it hard to be sure.Were Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus related?Carcharodontosaurus was a close relative of Giganotosaurus.Both dinosaurs are carcharodontosaurs - a group that also contains several other interesting dinosaurs, such as the peculiar-looking Concavenator and the British theropod Neovenator.Yet Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus didn't live in the same place. Giganotosaurus is found in South America.The close relation of these two dinosaurs may be because Africa and South America were once connected. They broke apart during the Cretaceous Period. Scientists are still debating exactly when the separation occurred.",

    "type": "large theropod",
    "length": "8.0m",
    "diet": "carnivorous",
    "period": "Late Cretaceous",
    "found_in": "ArgentinaCarnotaurus was a meat-eating dinosaur with two horns on the top of its head and very small arms.It had an unusually short snout and its head was very narrow when viewed from the front.Scientists have found lots of skin impressions for this dinosaur, so we know that it had scales over much of its body. It's unlikely that Carnotaurus or its relatives had feathers - no evidence of them has ever been found.We also don't have a complete skeleton. So far, nobody has ever found the tail or lower legs of Carnotaurus. This means we must use some guesswork based on the remains of this dinosaur's close relatives to do a full-body reconstruction.Why did Carnotaurus have horns?Nobody is quite sure what Carnotaurus' horns were for. Some experts think the dinosaur might have used them to fight rivals or attack prey.Another idea is that the horns might have helped to attract a mate or identify other Carnotaurus.Why were Carnotaurus' arms so small?Experts believe that Carnotaurus' ancestors would have had longer arms. Over time the arms got smaller and less useful.Carnotaurus probably didn't use its arms for much. They were a leftover trait from the dinosaur's earlier ancestors.Scientists call this a vestigial feature. It comes from the word 'vestige', meaning 'a small trace of something that existed a long time ago'.Many animals have vestigial features, including humans. For example, you still have a tailbone in your skeleton, even though you don't have a tail!Could Carnotaurus camouflage itself?In his novel The Lost World - the sequel to Jurassic Park - Michael Crichton described Carnotaurus as able to disguise itself with changing skin colours, like a chameleon.We don't have evidence that any dinosaur ever had this ability. If they did, we wouldn't be able to tell from fossil remains.It's always possible that any given dinosaur might have had an unusual or surprising feature that isn't shown in fossils. Fiction is a great place to explore interesting ideas.Were any other dinosaurs like Carnotaurus?Although Carnotaurus looked unusual with its tiny arms and short snout, it wasn't the only dinosaur like this.Carnotaurus was part of the abelisaur group. These closely related dinosaurs shared similar characteristics. But Carnotaurus is the only one known to have two horns on its head.Other abelisaurs include Abelisaurus itself, Majungasaurus and the Indian predator Rajasaurus.Was Carnotaurus related to Tyrannosaurus?Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus weren't very closely related.The two dinosaurs do share some similarities - both are meat-eating dinosaurs that walked on two legs. But they are also quite different.Tyrannosaurs had more powerful jaws and teeth than abelisaurs, as well as longer arms with two-fingered hands. Abelisaurs had four fingers on each hand. Tyrannosaurs could also grow much larger.Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus belong to two different dinosaur groups - ceratosaurs and coelurosaurs. These groups might have been evolving apart for more than 100 million years, since the Late Triassic Period.Where did Carnotaurus live?Carnotaurus fossils have only been found in Argentina. They occur in Late Cretaceous rocks that may have formed from the deposits of estuaries or tidal flats.We know Carnotaurus shared its environment with other dinosaurs. Researchers have found partial remains of as-yet unnamed ankylosaurs and hadrosaurs in the same area, but we don't know exactly what these dinosaurs were like.What did Carnotaurus eat?Although it was clearly a meat-eater, nobody knows for sure what types of animals Carnotaurus hunted.Many experts think it probably preyed on large sauropod dinosaurs. Teeth belonging to related abelisaurs have been found with sauropod remains, so it seems likely.Carnotaurus had a more flexible lower jaw than most other carnivorous dinosaurs. It may have been able to open its jaw wide, like a snake, to swallow big chunks of meat.Originally, researchers thought that the flexible jaw meant Carnotaurus didn't have a very strong bite. But more recent studies contradict this. Some experts think Carnotaurus may even have had a stronger bite force than an American alligator, the most powerful biting creature alive today.What is the correct plural of Carnotaurus?When you're talking about more than one dinosaur of a particular kind, you don't need to put an 's' on the end.You can think of it the same way as you would say 'two sheep'.This applies to all dinosaur names - so you can say 'two Carnotaurus' or 'five Velociraptor'.",

    "found_in": "Portugal, USACeratosaurus means 'horned lizard'. The dinosaur was given this name because it had a row of sharp horns on its head and a row of small, bony pieces of armour running along its back. It is not known what this body armour was for, but it could have been for protection from attack by other Ceratosaurus or larger theropods such as Allosaurus and Torvosaurus.Scientists have estimated that Ceratosaurus was about six to seven metres long. It seems to have been quite a rare animal - remains of it are much rarer than those of the Allosaurus that lived alongside it.Ceratosaurus was one of the biggest hunters in the Jurassic Period. Its prey probably included plant-eating dinosaurs, but some scientists have suggested that it may have fed upon aquatic animals such as fish, turtles and crocodiles.Ceratosaurus is remarkable for the very long, slender teeth in its upper jaw. These teeth could be over nine centimetres long, nearly as long as the lower jaw was deep, so they would almost stick out beyond it when the mouth was closed. Nobody really knows why the teeth were so long, but they may have helped it inflict deep, slashing wounds in prey.",

The sharp teeth and grasping claws of Coelophysis would have helped them to hold and kill their food.Cannibalism?A fossil find of an adult skeleton with what appeared to be young Coelophysis bones inside its rib cage led scientists to speculate that Coelophysis ate each other when the opportunity arose. Recent analysis has disproved this, however, by showing that the bones inside the ribcage are not a baby Coelophysis after all, but belong to a small crocodile.Hollow bonesCoelophysis means 'hollow form' and this comes from the hollow limb bones.",

    "diet": "carnivorous",
    "period": "Early Cretaceous",
    "found_in": "SpainConcavenator was a meat-eating dinosaur that lived in prehistoric Europe. It had a strange hump-shaped back. The researchers who first described the dinosaur used this feature to inspire the full species name. Concavenator corcovatus means 'hump-backed hunter from Cuenca'.Why did Concavenator have a hump?Two tall bones in Concavenator's spine created an unusual crest near its hips. Experts aren't sure how this crest would have looked in life. It might have supported a fleshy hump or a thin sail. Nobody knows why Concavenator had a back crest. Perhaps it helped the dinosaur identify other Concavenator. Alternatively, it might have had a role in temperature control, like a camel's hump.Was Concavenator a spinosaur?Although its tall back spines may look a bit like the sail of Spinosaurus, Concavenator wasn't a spinosaur.Instead, scientists think Concavenator belongs in the carcharodontosaur group - the 'shark-toothed lizards'. Although Concavenator wasn't a huge dinosaur, some of its relatives could reach very large sizes. Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus are among the biggest land predators ever discovered. Did Concavenator have feathers?Scientists disagree about whether Concavenator had feathers.The dinosaur's arm bone shows some evidence of what might be quill knobs, which are small marks showing where feathers attach. But some experts believe that these bumps are more likely to be muscle attachment scars. Unfortunately, the fossil in question is somewhat distorted, so it's hard to say for sure. Researchers have found fossil evidence for scaly skin covering some parts of Concavenator's body. However, nobody knows if it was scaly all over.Artists who depict the dinosaur as having feathers generally show primitive feathers, which were thin and hair-like.When did Concavenator live?Concavenator lived around 130 to 125 million years ago in the Early Cretaceous Period of what is now Spain.Its bones were found at the Las Hoyas fossil site, which at the time was the location of an inland lake. Other organisms found there include plants, fishes, worms and prehistoric crocodiles.Concavenator also lived alongside several other European dinosaurs. These included the meat-eating spinosaur Baryonyx and the plant-eaters Iguanodon and Hypsilophodon.",

    "period": "Early Cretaceous",
    "found_in": "USADeinonychus was a small meat-eating dinosaur. It lived in what is now North America during the Early Cretaceous Period.This dinosaur had a large, sickle-shaped talon on the second toe of each foot. When not in use the claw was held off the ground to keep it sharp.The species name - antirrhopus - means 'counterbalancing'. This is because Deinonychus' tail was long and stiff, helping to balance the animal's weight.Was Deinonychus a raptor?When we talk about raptors, we are really talking about dromaeosaurs. 'Raptor' isn't a proper scientific term. Dromaeosaurs were all small- to medium-sized hunters with large toe claws.Some dromaeosaurs have the word 'raptor' in their names, such as Velociraptor, Bambiraptor and Utahraptor. But there are many others that don't, including Deinonychus and Achillobator. That's why it's misleading to call them all raptors.Deinonychus was a close relative of Velociraptor. When the latter featured in the novel Jurassic Park, the author based the dinosaur's details on the bigger Deinonychus. The film and sequels did the same.Did Deinonychus have feathers?Nobody has found evidence to prove that Deinonychus had feathers. But scientists think it's very likely that it did.Some very closely related dinosaurs - including Velociraptor - definitely had them.When was Deinonychus discovered?The first Deinonychus fossils were found in southern Montana by John Ostrom and Grant Meyer in 1964. Ostrom published the findings and named the dinosaur five years later.His work caused a widespread change of opinion among palaeontologists. Before, people tended to think of dinosaurs as being slow, lumbering, cold-blooded beasts. Ostrom's studies helped scientists realise that they could be athletic, warm-blooded animals.This change of thought is sometimes called 'the dinosaur renaissance'. It brought a lot of new interest to the world of dinosaur science.How fast was Deinonychus?Although Deinonychus is often portrayed as a fast-moving hunter, it may not have been as agile as we first imagined.Many researchers now think that Deinonychus wasn't especially quick on its feet compared to other dinosaurs, although it wouldn't have been slow as such.Deinonychus had relatively short lower leg bones. Some experts think that these may have evolved to help Deinonychus attack with its toe claws. They suggest that the shorter bones helped to absorb the impact of its slashing strikes.Other scientists aren't convinced that Deinonychus' toe claws were very effective as slashing weapons. They think the claws helped Deinonychus to climb or to pin smaller prey animals to the ground.Tenontosaurus and Zephyrosaurus may have been among the dinosaurs hunted by Deinonychus.",

    "period": "Early Jurassic",
    "found_in": "USADilophosaurus was a meat-eating dinosaur that lived in what's now North America.It gets its name - meaning 'two-crested lizard' - from the distinctive double crests on top of its head.In life, they would probably be covered with hard keratin, the same material that makes up human hair and fingernails. The crests may have looked larger or a different shape to what we can see from the fossil skull. Nobody is certain what the crests were for. The most likely theories are that the dinosaur used them to identify other Dilophosaurus or to attract a mate. The crests probably weren't strong enough to have any use in combat. Who discovered Dilophosaurus?A Navajo man named Jesse Williams found the first partial Dilophosaurus skeletons on a reservation in Arizona, USA. The fossils were first studied by Samuel Welles, a scientist from California. To start with, he thought they belonged to a new species of Megalosaurus. But a decade later, Welles found a fossil showing the distinctive head crests. He realised the dinosaur was distinct enough to need a new name - Dilophosaurus. It was the first meat-eating dinosaur ever found with skull crests. Others identified since include Cryolophosaurus, Monolophosaurus, and Guanlong.More Dilophosaurus specimens were unearthed in 2001, showing previously unseen parts of the skeleton.Was Dilophosaurus venomous?In the 1990 novel Jurassic Park, Dilophosaurus was given the ability to spit venom. But there's no fossil evidence of this. Author Michael Crichton wanted to show that a dinosaur recreated from ancient DNA could be unpredictably dangerous, so he created the venom idea to illustrate this. Some living animals, such as spitting cobras and spitting spiders, do have this ability.In the 1993 movie adaptation, director Steven Spielberg and his design team also gave Dilophosaurus an expanding neck frill. This was another, more visual way to show that an extinct animal could have surprising traits. While the venom and neck frill were artistic creations for Jurassic Park, it's always possible that any dinosaur had unusual attributes that their fossils don't show.When did Dilophosaurus live?Dilophosaurus lived around 184 million years ago during the Early Jurassic Period. At this time, the North American environment was a desert with many rivers. As the seasons changed, sand dunes would migrate in and out of the wetter areas where the dinosaurs spent most time.What did Dilophosaurus eat?Dilophosaurus had very distinctive jaws. Its upper jaw had a big notch that created a sizeable tooth gap.Originally, scientists thought that the jaws would be quite weak due to this tooth gap. They imagined that Dilophosaurus only hunted smaller prey animals. Other experts suggested that it could have eaten fish due to similarities to other reptiles with this diet.Later studies indicate that Dilophosaurus had stronger jaws than was first thought. There's some evidence it preyed on a four-legged, plant-eating dinosaur called Sarahsaurus.Either way, Dilophosaurus had quite a light build and was probably very good at running down prey. For this reason, most researchers think it was likely an active hunter rather than a scavenger.Did Dilophosaurus have feathers?It's unclear whether Dilophosaurus had feathers. There are fossil footprints that may show evidence of them. But some scientists argue that the footprints don't belong to Dilophosaurus and that the 'feathers' could be something else. We'll have to wait for more evidence to know for sure.",

    "period": "Late Jurassic",
    "found_in": "USADiplodocus had a long neck that it would have used to reach high and low vegetation, and to drink water. Thereâs been some debate over how it would have held such a long neck.Scientists now think that ligaments running from the hip to the back of the neck would have allowed Diplodocus to hold its neck in a horizontal position without using muscles. The back bones are split down the middle, creating a space that could have held the ligaments. Diplodocus had a very long, whip-like tail and it may have had narrow, pointed, bony spines lining its back.What does Diplodocus mean?Diplodocus translates as âdouble beamâ. It refers to the dinosaurâs tail bones.The bones underneath the tail, which in many other dinosaurs are straight and pointy, have a two-beamed shape in Diplodocus. They look a bit like an upside-down âVâ.The scientist who named Diplodocus thought it was the only dinosaur with this kind of bone, but later discoveries revealed many other long-necked dinosaurs had them too.Was Diplodocus the biggest dinosaur?Diplodocus was a very large animal. In fact, it may have been one of the longest dinosaurs, partly due to its extremely long tail.But comparing it to other long-necked giants of its day, it wasnât the tallest. With its upward-sloping body shape, Giraffatitan stood around 25 metres tall and could eat leaves from the highest treetops.Additionally, if we look across the entire history of dinosaurs, the enormous titanosaurs from the Late Cretaceous â such as Patagotitan and Dreadnoughtus â were much larger and heavier.Why did Diplodocus have a long neck?Nobody knows for sure why Diplodocus and other sauropod dinosaurs had such a unique body shape. Over the years, researchers have put forward different theories.Diplodocus needed its whip-like tail for defence. So, one idea is that the long neck would act as a counterbalance and stop the dinosaur from being too heavy at one end. But many scientists today arenât convinced.Another theory is that because Diplodocus was so big and heavy, it would have been best for it to move around as little as possible to save its energy. A long neck enabled it to reach a wide array of food sources without having to move its body much.Where are Diplodocus fossils found?So far, all Diplodocus bones have been unearthed in the Morrison Formation â a fossil site that spans several states in the USA.Many other well-known Jurassic dinosaurs have also been found there, including Allosaurus, Brontosaurus and Stegosaurus.When Diplodocus was alive the environment was hot and dry, like a savannah. There were many tree ferns and cycads, as well as lots of non-dinosaur life such as frogs, lizards, turtles and flying reptiles called pterosaurs.A Natural History Museum iconIn 1905, the wealthy businessman Andrew Carnegie donated a cast of a Diplodocus skeleton to us. It was based on the original specimen in the Carnegie Museum in the USA.King Edward VII had requested a copy of the newly discovered dinosaur after seeing a picture of it in Carnegieâs Scottish castle. From 1979 to early 2017 the cast â known affectionately as Dippy â was on display in our Hintze Hall.In 1993, Dippyâs tail was lifted from the ground after research revealed that Diplodocus tails would have been raised.Every two years or so, our experts used specialist equipment to clean the 292 bones that make up Dippy. It took two staff two days to clean and maintain the cast for future generations to enjoy.In January 2017, Dippy left the Natural History Museum to prepare for a UK tour. After returning briefly in 2022, the famous cast is now on show at the Herbert Art Gallery & Museum in Coventry, on long-term loan.A new bronze castIn July 2024, we unveiled a full-size bronze version of Carnegieâs skeleton in our gardens. Read the story about how it was made.Children from local community groups helped to name this shiny new Diplodocus. Thanks to their creativity, itâs called Fern.You can visit Fern the Diplodocus, supported by Kusuma Trust, in our gardens.",

    "found_in": "ArgentinaDreadnoughtus was a giant sauropod, a member of the group called titanosaurs. It lived in South America during the Cretaceous Period.Many titanosaurs are known from only a few bones, but scientists have found around half of the skeleton of Dreadnoughtus. This means it is better understood than some of the other giant sauropods of the time. The skull has never been found though. How big was Dreadnoughtus? Thanks to having a good amount of fossil material to study, experts have been able to estimate the weight of this enormous dinosaur. A calculation published in 2020 puts the animal's weight at around 48 metric tons. That's about the same as eight African elephants! However, depending on the method used, estimates have ranged from 22 tonnes to 59 tonnes. The remains of only two Dreadnoughtus specimens have ever been uncovered. Scientists found that the largest one wasn't even fully grown. This means that nobody knows for sure how big this dinosaur could really get. The name Dreadnoughtus means 'fears nothing', because its enormous size would have made it difficult for predators to attack. It is also a reference to the dreadnoughts - huge battleships that fought in wars of the early twentieth century. How much did Dreadnoughtus eat?Dreadnoughtus was so huge that it would have had to eat nearly constantly and spend as little energy as possible in order to survive. The dinosaur's long neck meant that it would have been able to reach a large variety of plant food sources without moving its body too much. This way, it would have been able to eat vast amounts without burning too many calories. Was Dreadnoughtus the largest dinosaur?The biggest Dreadnoughtus specimen ever found was not fully grown when it died, so scientists can't say for sure how large this dinosaur could grow in adulthood.As far as anyone can tell, some other huge titanosaurs, such as Patagotitan and Argentinosaurus, may have been bigger than Dreadnoughtus. Did Dreadnoughtus really have air sacs?Dreadnoughtus features in the Apple TV+ documentary, Prehistoric Planet. In this show, the dinosaur can be seen with inflatable air sacs on its neck. While there is no fossil evidence to show that Dreadnoughtus really had visible air sacs, all sauropod dinosaurs had internal air sacs. These made the enormous animals lighter than they would otherwise have been. There is no doubt that many dinosaurs would have had surprising external soft tissue features. These features rarely get preserved as fossils - so for now, we can only guess at the unusual features that Dreadnoughtus might have had.",

    "type": "large theropod",
    "length": "6.0mWeight:490kg",
    "diet": "omnivorousHow it moved: on 2 legs",
    "period": "Late Cretaceous",
    "found_in": "MongoliaGallimimus was a fast-moving dinosaur that lived in prehistoric Asia.This dinosaur and its relatives are sometimes called ostrich dinosaurs due to their appearance. Gallimimus was one of the biggest, growing to be twice as tall as an adult human. The name Gallimimus means 'chicken mimic' and comes from the fact its neck bones look like those of chickens.Scientists are confident Gallimimus had feathers. There's no direct evidence, but Ornithomimus and other closely related dinosaurs had them.How fast was Gallimimus?Experts estimate that Gallimimus could run at speeds of 47-55 kilometres per hour - more than twice as fast as a fit human.Gallimimus' impressive sprinting power was probably its main method of keeping itself safe from predators.But it was likely slower than a modern ostrich, which can run at up to 70 kilometres per hour. An ostrich is much smaller than Gallimimus, and the dinosaur's arms and tail would have added to its weight.Did Gallimimus move in flocks?The movie Jurassic Park shows a flock of Gallimimus stampeding together. Polish scientist Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, who discovered the first ever Gallimimus skeleton, called it a \"beautiful scene\". But did this happen in real life?It's possible, although nobody knows for sure.There's some evidence Gallimimus lived in groups. A single bone bed contained multiple skeletons, suggesting they died together.What did Gallimimus eat?Gallimimus had a toothless beak a bit like that of modern ducks and geese. This suggests it may have eaten small animals and insects.Some scientists think Gallimimus might have used its beak to filter food from water or mud, like some ducks do. Birds that feed in this way have similar structures in their beaks to Gallimimus. However, other researchers say these structures were more like the ridges in the mouths of herbivorous animals used to cut and eat tough plants.The most likely answer is that Gallimimus was an omnivore, meaning it ate both plants and animals depending on what was available.Was Gallimimus related to ostriches?While Gallimimus looked somewhat ostrich-like, it wasn't closely related.Ostriches and other modern birds evolved from a different branch of the dinosaur family tree known as the maniraptorans. This group includes many feathered and bird-like dinosaurs, such as Velociraptor and Archaeopteryx. So, the ostrich-like nature of Gallimimus is a coincidence.When two unrelated animals happen to evolve similar traits, it's called convergent evolution. This might happen because the two animals live in the same type of environment or need to do similar things to survive, so they end up evolving along the same lines.Did Tyrannosaurus rex prey on Gallimimus?Although the film Jurassic Park depicts a Tyrannosaurus attacking Gallimimus, these two dinosaurs would never have met in real life.Gallimimus lived in Asia, while T. rex lived in North America.But a T. rex relative - another very large tyrannosaur called Tarbosaurus - did live in Late Cretaceous Mongolia and may well have hunted Gallimimus.Although there's no conclusive evidence of a tyrannosaur preying on Gallimimus, Tarbosaurus bite marks have been found on a related dinosaur - the hump-backed herbivore Deinocheirus.",

    "found_in": "ArgentinaGiganotosaurus was a very large meat-eating dinosaur that lived in prehistoric South America.Scientists havenât yet discovered a complete Giganotosaurus specimen. Some of the skeleton is still unknown.Was Giganotosaurus the biggest meat-eating dinosaur?Without having the full skeleton, itâs hard to say for sure just how big Giganotosaurus was and how it compared to other dinosaurs.At around 13 metres long, it was probably longer but more lightly built than the bulkier and heavier Tyrannosaurus rex.Carcharodontosaurus was also potentially very large and may have been as long as Giganotosaurus.The longest known meat-eating dinosaur was Spinosaurus, at 14 metres long.When was Giganotosaurus discovered?Giganotosaurus was first discovered in 1993 in the Patagonia region of Argentina.The species was officially named Giganotosaurus carolinii in 1995. The name refers not only to fossil hunter RubÃ©n Carolini who discovered the first specimen but to the location where he found it, as Giganotosaurus means giant southern lizard.When did Giganotosaurus go extinct?Giganotosaurus went extinct around 98 million years ago, during the Late Cretaceous Period. This was long before the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous around 66 million years ago that wiped out the dinosaurs.What did Giganotosaurus eat?Given its huge size, Giganotosaurus was almost certainly the apex predator of its environment â meaning it was at the top of the food chain. But experts arenât sure what it hunted.Some scientists think they might have preyed on very large sauropod dinosaurs, working together in packs to take down these plant-eating giants.But other researchers think thatâs unlikely, as there arenât many meat-eating animals alive today that try to take on prey bigger than themselves. They say Giganotosaurus might have looked for smaller dinosaurs or scavenged large creatures that were already dead. Either way, Giganotosaurus had very strong jaws and could certainly deliver a powerful bite.",

    "period": "Late Cretaceous",
    "found_in": "MongoliaGigantoraptor is the largest known member of the oviraptorosaur dinosaur group. Oviraptorosaur dinosaurs had distinctive parrot-like skulls with beaks.Some oviraptorosaurs had a bony crest on their head. But the full skull of Gigantoraptor is unknown. Scientists have only found its lower jaw.While many of its smaller relatives definitely had feathers, we don't know if Gigantoraptor did.Only one specimen of Gigantoraptor has ever been found, and scientists think it was around 12 years old when it died. They think young Gigantoraptor may have grown up more quickly and reached full size sooner than many other two-legged dinosaurs.How big was Gigantoraptor?At eight metres long, Gigantoraptor was much larger than any of its known relatives.It was so big that when the first fossil was found - a huge leg bone - people thought it belonged to a sauropod - a long-necked dinosaur such as Diplodocus.The discovery happened when Chinese dinosaur expert Xu Xing was taking part in a documentary about how he had discovered a sauropod dinosaur in the same place. The film crew asked to record him digging up another bone for their video.But as he unearthed the fossil, Xu realised that it wasn't a sauropod at all - it was a new giant theropod! What did Gigantoraptor eat?Experts believe smaller oviraptorosaurs lived on a mixed diet of fruit, shellfish, eggs and insects. But the jaws of Gigantoraptor looked a little different.Gigantoraptor might have dined on both vegetation and meat to sustain its larger size.The broad shape of its toothless beak could mean that it wasn't too fussy about exactly what it ate.Which other dinosaurs lived with Gigantoraptor?We know that Gigantoraptor lived alongside several other Late Cretaceous dinosaurs in what's now Inner Mongolia.These include an early relative of Tyrannosaurus called Alectrosaurus, the titanosaur Sonidosaurus and some hadrosaurs, Bactrosaurus and Gilmoreosaurus.Was Gigantoraptor a raptor?In everyday speech, 'raptor' is often used as shorthand for a member of the dromaeosaur group - two-legged hunters with distinctive sickle-clawed toes.This is because many dromaeosaurs have 'raptor' in their names, such as Velociraptor, Bambiraptor and Utahraptor.However, not all raptor-named dinosaurs are dromaeosaurs. Gigantoraptor and its relatives - the oviraptorosaurs - are a closely related but separate group.",

    "name": "Hypsilophodon",

    "meaning": "high-crested tooth",
    "type": "small ornithischian",
    "length": "2.0mWeight:20kg",
    "diet": "herbivorousTeeth: turtle-like beak and broad, chisel-like teethFood:plant materialHow it moved: on 2 legs",
    "period": "Early Cretaceous",
    "found_in": "England, United KingdomHypsilophodon was a small, agile dinosaur that lived in prehistoric England.Scientists used to think Hypsilophodon spent a lot of time in trees. This came from a misunderstanding of the dinosaurâs toe bones. We now know Hypsilophodon lived on the ground and was good at running. Several Hypsilophodon individuals were discovered together at one fossil site, suggesting they lived and died together. Some experts say this dinosaur probably lived in groups, like deer. Where did Hypsilophodon live?All the known Hypsilophodon fossils come from the Isle of Wight, UK.Today, the island is well known as a fossil hotspot. Lots of prehistoric animals have been found there, including many other dinosaurs, crocodiles, mammals and flying reptiles called pterosaurs. In the Early Cretaceous Period, the Isle of Wight had a warm and humid environment with a lot of rivers and swamps. This made it an ideal place for fossils to form. Watch our video about the Isle of Wight, dinosaur island.What did Hypsilophodon eat?Hypsilophodon was quite small, so it wouldâve mostly eaten plants that grew low to the ground.It used its sharp beak to clip vegetation, and experts think it probably had cheeks to help it chew its food.Hypsilophodon had five-fingered hands, which they used to grasp branches and other food items.What does Hypsilophodon mean?The meaning of Hypsilophodon is a little confusing. The exact translation is âhigh-crested toothâ, but this dinosaur didnât have crested teeth.Renowned English scientist Thomas Henry Huxley created the name in 1869. At the time, dinosaur naming conventions werenât yet establishedHuxley was inspired by another dinosaur name â Iguanodon, which means âiguana toothâ. He wanted his new dinosaur name to be similar in style. So, he took the old Latin name for the iguana â Hypsilophus, meaning âhigh crestâ â and added the Greek â-odonâ, meaning âtoothâ, to create the name Hypsilophodon. So in a way, both Iguanodon and Hypsilophodon mean âiguana toothâ.Did Hypsilophodon have feathers?Hypsilophodon belongs to the ornithischian dinosaur group, otherwise known as the âbird-hippedâ dinosaurs. Despite the name, these dinosaurs had no direct relation to modern birds, which evolved from saurischian or âlizard-hippedâ dinosaurs. There isnât much evidence of ornithischian dinosaurs having feathers. A few have been shown to have primitive feather-like structures on their bodies, such as Psittacosaurus. But these seem to be exceptions. Almost all other ornithischians show no feather-like coverings at all. As far as scientists can currently tell from available fossils, most of the bird-hipped dinosaurs didnât have feathers, and thereâs no evidence that Hypsilophodon had them.See Hypsilophodon in our gardensIn July 2024, we added a bronze cast of a Hypsilophodon skeleton to our new gardens.

It was one of the first dinosaurs ever found and the first named.When and where was Megalosaurus found?When Megalosaurus fossils were first discovered during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, nobody knew what a dinosaur was.From time to time, somebody would find something unusual and not know what to make of it. Items such as a single tooth, part of a leg bone and then a piece of the lower jaw were found, puzzled over and speculated about. All these specimens were discovered around Oxfordshire, England.People found even more mysterious bones in the early 1800s, but it wasnât until around 1818 that William Buckland â a professor from the University of Oxford â began to study the remains in detail.With the help of other scientists including the famous French expert Georges Cuvier, Buckland came to think that the extinct animal might have been a huge lizard that walked on four legs, almost like an oversized iguana. Yet even 200 years ago, he was quick to work out that the animal walked on straight legs, rather than with its legs sprawled out like a lizard.Many years later the first fossils of bipedal dinosaurs were discovered, making it clear that Megalosaurus walked on two legs. A complete Megalosaurus skeleton has yet to be found.How was Megalosaurus named?In 1824, Megalosaurus was the first dinosaur in history given a name. In fact, it was named before the word âdinosaurâ had even been invented. That didnât happen until 1842, almost twenty years later.Because it was one of the first dinosaurs ever found, many new fossil discoveries over the years have been said to belong to Megalosaurus. At one point, scientists thought there were lots of species of Megalosaurus â more than any other dinosaur.But science has advanced. We can now be much surer about which fossils are Megalosaurus.These days, we think there was only one species â Megalosaurus bucklandii. All the other misnamed fossil specimens have been reassigned to other dinosaurs.How big was Megalosaurus?Over the years, researchers have given many different size estimates for Megalosaurus.In Victorian times, when nobody knew what the dinosaur really looked like, people thought it might have been 20 metres long. Thatâs huge â almost as long as a tennis court!As more discoveries were made, scientists started to get a better idea of Megalosaurusâ true size. Our founder Richard Owen gave a smaller estimate of nine metres long in 1842.Today, experts think it was more likely to have been around six metres long.So even though the name Megalosaurus means âbig lizardâ, this dinosaur wasnât huge by Jurassic theropod standards.Allosaurus was probably bigger, at around nine metres long. Saurophaganax â which some researchers think might have been the same dinosaur as Allosaurus â could have reached 10.5 metres in length.When did Megalosaurus go extinct?Megalosaurus lived during the Bathonian Age â a stretch of time midway through the Middle Jurassic Period, around 168â165 million years ago.No Megalosaurus fossils have been found in rocks from any other geological age. As far as we can tell, the dinosaur may have been extinct by the end of the Bathonian.Historically, artists have often portrayed Megalosaurus together with Iguanodon, as the two dinosaurs were among the earliest discovered. But they didnât live at the same time. Megalosaurus would have been extinct by the time Iguanodon appeared in the Early Cretaceous.Did Megalosaurus have feathers?We don't know for sure if Megalosaurus had feathers.Evidence of feathers has been found in a potentially related dinosaur called Sciurumimus, which may mean that Megalosaurus had some too.Some experts now think that the two dinosaurs werenât as closely related as we first thought. Itâs very hard to say.Megalosaurus in popular cultureMegalosaurus has captured the public imagination over the years. It has featured in many unusual places.Charles Dickens mentioned the dinosaur in the very first paragraph of his 1852â1853 novel Bleak House. Dickens described a fanciful image of a gigantic, slow Megalosaurus plodding along a London street.The Victorian sculptor Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins created several huge statues of prehistoric animals, including Megalosaurus, for the Crystal Palace gardens in 1854.The Crystal Palace statues now look very outdated as they show Megalosaurus and other extinct creatures as bulky, lumbering beasts. Even so, they are important historic structures. They can still be seen in the gardens.Megalosaurus has continued to feature in various places in more recent times.In 2013, the carnivore appeared on limited edition Royal Mail stamps. Then in 2020, we collaborated with the Royal Mint and dinosaur artist Bob Nicholls to feature Megalosaurus in a special set of fifty pence coins.",

    "period": "Early Cretaceous",
    "found_in": "ChinaMicroraptor was a very small, feathered dinosaur with wings on its legs as well as its arms.As a member of the dromaeosaur group, it was related to the well-known dinosaur, Velociraptor. Of all the dromaeosaurs, we have the most fossils for Microraptor. Around 300 specimens have been found so far, indicating that this was a very common dinosaur.Another winged dinosaur, originally named Cryptovolans, is now thought to be the same as Microraptor.Was Microraptor the smallest dinosaur?By dinosaur standards, Microraptor was tiny - about the size of a crow. At around 77 centimetres in length, it's often said to be 'the smallest extinct dinosaur'.It's very hard to say which dinosaur was definitely the smallest. Anchiornis may have been smaller than Microraptor. The largest Anchiornis specimen we have is only about 62 centimetres long.Could Microraptor fly?When Microraptor was first studied, scientists thought it was only capable of gliding.Later investigations showed that it could probably properly fly, like a modern bird.Researchers have done experiments to test how Microraptor might have used its hind wings in the air. They found that, in theory, the best flying position would be to have the legs spread out sideways from the body. But we don't know if Microraptor's hips were flexible enough to do that.Was Microraptor a pterosaur?Pterosaurs - sometimes informally called 'pterodactyls' - were prehistoric flying reptiles. But they weren't dinosaurs.Dinosaur skeletons have a unique type of hip joint that pterosaurs didn't have. So, while Microraptor was probably able to fly, it wasn't a pterosaur but a flying dinosaur. It's closely related to modern birds.The 'Archaeoraptor' hoaxOne of the first known Microraptor specimens became internationally famous for an unusual reason. It was part of a notorious fossil hoax that took place in the early 2000s.A fossil hunter in China claimed to have found an amazing specimen of a never-before-seen winged dinosaur. Well-known science magazines wrote about it and called it Archaeoraptor, meaning 'early hunter'. But then some experts grew suspicious that the specimen wasn't what it seemed.After investigating, it turned out that the fossil was a fake. It had been made by joining together several different real dinosaur remains. The tail of Microraptor was added to the front half of another small dinosaur called Yanornis and an as-yet-unnamed third animal. What colour was Microraptor?In 2012, a new Microraptor fossil was discovered with preserved pigment cells. From these, researchers learned that Microraptor likely had shiny black feathers.Some scientists originally thought that Microraptor's large eyes meant that it hunted at night. But now we know about the glossy feathers, this theory seems less likely. Out of all the modern birds with shiny coats, none are night hunters.What did Microraptor eat?Thanks to the large number of Microraptor specimens unearthed, we have a good idea of the types of food this dinosaur ate.Microraptor skeletons have been found with mammal bones, bird remains and fish scales in their stomachs.In 2019, scientists were able to study a complete, never-before-seen prehistoric lizard they found in the belly of a Microraptor. They named this new lizard Indrasaurus, after the Vedic god Indra who - according to legend - was swallowed by a dragon.Microraptor might have scavenged its food in addition to hunting.",

    "period": "Late Cretaceous",
    "found_in": "Canada, USAPachycephalosaurus was an unusual-looking dinosaur. It stood on two legs, had a beak for cropping plants and had a large bony dome on its head surrounded by spikes and bumps.Some scientists think that the animal used its hard dome in head-butting contests, similar to the way modern-day rams use their horns.Other experts think that the head dome may have been used for display. Perhaps it had many uses - like the antlers of modern deer, which are used both for fighting and for display.When and where did Pachycephalosaurus live?Pachycephalosaurus lived in the Late Cretaceous Period of North America. Its fossils have been found in Montana, South Dakota, Wyoming and Alberta.The environment was subtropical, with warm humid air and many flowering plants.Pachycephalosaurus shared its habitat with many other dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops and Ankylosaurus.What did Pachycephalosaurus eat?Experts think Pachycephalosaurus was herbivorous, living on a diet of leaves, fruit and seeds. But nobody knows for sure.Some of the dinosaur's front teeth look a bit like those of carnivorous dinosaurs. This has led some scientists to suggest that Pachycephalosaurus might have eaten meat, too.Are Stygimoloch and Dracorex the same as Pachycephalosaurus?For many years, we thought that Stygimoloch, Dracorex and Pachycephalosaurus were all separate, but possibly closely related, dinosaurs.Now, most scientists believe that Stygimoloch and Dracorex were younger forms of Pachycephalosaurus. So those dinosaur names aren't often used.Who discovered Pachycephalosaurus?An American fossil collector named Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden found the first ever Pachycephalosaurus fragment around 1860. Experts at the time thought it might be from an armadillo-like creature. They named it Tylosteus.The name Pachycephalosaurus was created in 1943 by Barnum Brown and Erich Maren Schlaikjer, after more fossils were discovered.It wasn't realised until the 1980s that the 'Tylosteus' fossil belonged to Pachycephalosaurus.",

    "period": "Late Cretaceous",
    "found_in": "Canada, USAParasaurolophus was a duck-billed dinosaur with a long, distinctive head crest. It lived in what is now North America during the Late Cretaceous Period.Over the years, experts have gone back and forth as to whether Parasaurolophus walked on two legs or four. We now think it did both. It probably spent most of its life walking on all fours, but it could raise itself onto its back legs.Fossilised skin impressions show that Parasaurolophus had scaly, pebbled skin.A dinosaur found in China called Charonosaurus looked very similar. Some scientists think it could be the same animal as Parasaurolophus. What does Parasaurolophus mean?Parasaurolophus is partly named after Saurolophus another duck-billed dinosaur. Its name means 'lizard crest'.The Canadian scientist William Parks, who wrote the first paper about Parasaurolophus, thought it looked very similar, so he gave it a name meaning 'like Saurolophus'.What did Parasaurolophus use its crest for?Parasaurolophus is famous for its crest, which was hollow. Starting from the dinosaur's nostrils, an empty tube ran through the crest, looped around at the end and then travelled back to the skull.Nobody knows for sure what the crest was for. Experts think Parasaurolophus may have used it to spot other members of its species, to communicate with others by blowing air through the crest to create loud sounds, or to control its body temperature. The crest probably had more than one use.Researchers have found a few different Parasaurolophus skulls. Some of them had smaller, differently shaped crests. Perhaps this was because some were from males and others were from females, or maybe the individuals were different ages.So far, we know of three species of Parasaurolophus. Each of these also has a different crest shape and size.What did Parasaurolophus sound like?In the 1990s, scientists realised they could recreate the sound a Parasaurolophus would make if it blew air through its crest.The result is a deep, trumpeting bellow that the dinosaur might have used to warn other Parasaurolophus about nearby dangers. You can listen to this computer-generated sound on YouTube.Of course, nobody knows if Parasaurolophus really sounded like this. But for now, it's as close as we're likely to get to hearing a real dinosaur.Did Parasaurolophus eat meat?No, Parasaurolophus lived on a diet of plants. It ate by making a tooth-grinding chewing motion.Like other members of the hadrosaur group, Parasaurolophus had a complicated arrangement of hundreds of teeth. But it only used a few at a time. Most of the teeth were kept in reserve, ready to replace old ones worn down by grinding plant matter.What hunted Parasaurolophus?Parasaurolophus lived alongside many large predators, including Gorgosaurus and Daspletosaurus, two earlier relatives of Tyrannosaurus rex.Other than being quite large - which made it difficult for an attacker to handle - nobody knows if Parasaurolophus had any special way of defending itself. Scientists think it probably lived in herds and there's safety in numbers.",

It was far longer, almost twice as tall and more than three times heavier than Diplodocus.Patagotitan is a titanosaur, a type of sauropod. Not all titanosaurs were particularly large, but Patagotitan was. Its thigh bone (femur) alone was 2.38 metres long.Other contenders for the title of world's largest dinosaur are Argentinosaurus and Puertasaurus. But these dinosaurs are only known from very fragmentary remains. In some cases, only partial bones have been found, so the size of the rest of the bone has had to be estimated.Patagotitan is far more complete and is the one whose size scientists can be most sure of, although different methods of estimating body mass mean there is still some debate over exactly how heavy it was. The most recent estimates range from 42,500 to 71,400 kilogrammes.Multiple floods, multiple Patagotitan dinosaurs discoveredPatagotitan was found at La Flecha Ranch in Patagonia, Argentina, in 2010, when a ranch worker spotted an enormous dinosaur bone poking out of the ground.Scientists were brought in to investigate, and during digs in 2012, 2013 and 2015, they unearthed hundreds of fossil bones belonging to at least six dinosaurs, which died and were buried in three distinct floods.The species name mayorum honours the Mayo family, the owners of the ranch, for their hospitality during the fieldwork. Their ranch is still the only location where Patagotitan fossils have been found.",

It lived towards the end of the Cretaceous Period.Very few fossils of this dinosaur have been found - only four bones belonging to a single individual. These include one neck bone, one backbone and two tail bones that were all unearthed in Argentina in 2001.Like all sauropods, Puertasaurus was a plant-eating dinosaur. The researchers who discovered its remains also found fossilised tree trunks nearby. This suggests that it may have lived in a forest habitat.The dinosaur's full name - Puertasaurus reuili - refers to two fossil hunters who discovered and worked on the remains: Pablo Puerta and Santiago Reuil. Was Puertasaurus the largest dinosaur?With so few Puertasaurus fossils to study, it's not possible to say once and for all how big this dinosaur would have been when it was alive.However, the existing remains are so enormous that scientists believe that Puertasaurus may have been among the very largest dinosaurs. Current estimates are that it was about 30 metres long and weighed about 50 tonnes.Many experts think it is likely that Puertasaurus would have rivalled other titanosaurs like Argentinosaurus and Patagotitan in size, but nobody can say for sure which was the largest.",

    "type": "small theropodDiet:carnivorousTeeth: lots of sharp, pointed teethFood:other animalsHow it moved: on 2 legsWhen it lived:Late Cretaceous, 84-71 million years agoFound in:France, SpainPyroraptor was a small, meat-eating dinosaur that lived in what is now France and Spain. It got its name, which means 'fire thief', because its remains were first found after a destructive forest fire in Provence, France.This dinosaur is known from very few fossils. Only a handful of small bones and teeth have been unearthed. So full-body reconstructions of Pyroraptor are largely guesswork.Scientists think Pyroraptor was probably a dromaeosaur, and that it may have been similar to Velociraptor. But with so few fossils it's hard to tell how closely they were related.Dromaeosaurs are rare in Europe. Another, called Variraptor, was found in the same place in France as Pyroraptor. Some experts think it might be the same dinosaur. Could Pyroraptor swim?The film Jurassic World: Dominion shows Pyroraptor diving underwater to attack the main characters.It's very hard to say if any dinosaur could swim in real life, as swimming isn't usually an activity that shows in fossil evidence.Most modern animals can swim, with some exceptions such as tortoises. So most experts assume that dinosaurs - especially small- to medium-sized ones like Pyroraptor - could at least doggy paddle. But nobody knows if Pyroraptor could really dive under the surface and swim for long periods.When did Pyroraptor go extinct?Pyroraptor fossils were discovered in rocks from the Campanian and Maastrichtian stages of the Late Cretaceous Period. That means it must have been alive 84 to 71 million years ago.Scientists aren't sure exactly when Pyroraptor went extinct, but it probably wasn't around by the time of the meteorite impact that played a major role in wiping out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.How big was Pyroraptor?It's very difficult to work out how large the whole dinosaur would have been because so few Pyroraptor fossils have been found.It might have been around the same size as Velociraptor, or smaller. We might get a better idea in the future if more remains are discovered.

    "found_in": "France, SpainPyroraptor was a small, meat-eating dinosaur that lived in what is now France and Spain. It got its name, which means 'fire thief', because its remains were first found after a destructive forest fire in Provence, France.This dinosaur is known from very few fossils. Only a handful of small bones and teeth have been unearthed. So full-body reconstructions of Pyroraptor are largely guesswork.Scientists think Pyroraptor was probably a dromaeosaur, and that it may have been similar to Velociraptor. But with so few fossils it's hard to tell how closely they were related.Dromaeosaurs are rare in Europe. Another, called Variraptor, was found in the same place in France as Pyroraptor. Some experts think it might be the same dinosaur. Could Pyroraptor swim?The film Jurassic World: Dominion shows Pyroraptor diving underwater to attack the main characters.It's very hard to say if any dinosaur could swim in real life, as swimming isn't usually an activity that shows in fossil evidence.Most modern animals can swim, with some exceptions such as tortoises. So most experts assume that dinosaurs - especially small- to medium-sized ones like Pyroraptor - could at least doggy paddle. But nobody knows if Pyroraptor could really dive under the surface and swim for long periods.When did Pyroraptor go extinct?Pyroraptor fossils were discovered in rocks from the Campanian and Maastrichtian stages of the Late Cretaceous Period. That means it must have been alive 84 to 71 million years ago.Scientists aren't sure exactly when Pyroraptor went extinct, but it probably wasn't around by the time of the meteorite impact that played a major role in wiping out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.How big was Pyroraptor?It's very difficult to work out how large the whole dinosaur would have been because so few Pyroraptor fossils have been found.It might have been around the same size as Velociraptor, or smaller. We might get a better idea in the future if more remains are discovered. For now, we know that both dinosaurs had a similar-sized curved toe claw, measuring almost seven centimetres along the outer edge.",

    "length": "6.6m",
    "diet": "carnivorous",
    "period": "Late Cretaceous",
    "found_in": "IndiaRajasaurus was a large meat-eating dinosaur that lived towards the end of the Cretaceous Period in what is now India. It was a kind of abelisaur, a group that also contains the well-known dinosaur Carnotaurus.Rajasaurus sported a single short horn on the top of its head. No one knows for sure what it used this horn for, but experts think it might have been for display or for head-butting other Rajasaurus.Only parts of the skeleton of Rajasaurus have been found. But scientists have a good idea of what the whole animal may have looked like as they have more complete fossils of some of its relatives, such as Majungasaurus.Many abelisaurs had very short, stubby arms. It's likely that Rajasaurus did too, although we don't know for sure.How big was Rajasaurus?At 6.6 metres long, Rajasaurus was one of the larger members of the abelisaurid group. But this isn't massive by Late Cretaceous theropod standards. Dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus, Giganotosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus could get much bigger.What did Rajasaurus prey on?Rajasaurus was likely an ambush predator able to bring down large animals with its strong neck and jaw muscles. It may also have scavenged for food. Unfortunately, scientists know little about the types of dinosaurs Rajasaurus preyed on.Where was Rajasaurus found?Rajasaurus was discovered in the Lameta Formation, a sequence of rocks formed during the Late Cretaceous, when India was an island.Sitting on top of these rocks are many layers of basalt, a type of rock formed from lava. These layers are called the Deccan Traps. They were created by some of the largest volcanic eruptions ever.Dinosaurs in India may have gone extinct around 350,000 years before the mass extinction event that wiped out most dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous Period. This might have been due to volcanic eruptions.",

    "found_in": "ChinaSinosauropteryx was a small, meat-eating dinosaur. It had a covering of primitive feathers, which were thin and hair-like. It was the first feathered dinosaur discovered that wasn't directly related to birds. Another special thing about Sinosauropteryx is that scientists used it to work out a dinosaur's colour pattern for the first time.Sinosauropteryx was a close relative of another small dinosaur, Compsognathus, which lived in Europe.When was Sinosauropteryx found?A fossil hunter named Li Yumin discovered the first Sinosauropteryx remains in 1996. He sold his fossils to two Chinese science museums.The National Geological Museum in Beijing and some visiting experts were quick to see the importance of the find. It was another key piece of the puzzle showing the evolutionary relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. There was some disagreement about Sinosauropteryx's feather-like coating. Some researchers doubted that the fossilised marks really showed feathers. They thought the marks might be fibres of collagen - the protein that makes up muscles, tendons and skin.Other scientists were able to show that they couldn't be collagen and had to be real, if basic, feathers.What did Sinosauropteryx eat?Sinosauropteryx ate small animals. We know this because a tiny lizard was preserved in the stomach of one of the fossil specimens. Another dinosaur skeleton that experts think might be a Sinosauropteryx has been found with mammal bones in its belly. One of these prey animals, Zhangheotherium, had platypus-style spurs on its ankles, suggesting it may have been venomous.Where did Sinosauropteryx live?Sinosauropteryx lived during the Early Cretaceous Period in what's now northern China. At that time, the environment was quite cool with an average yearly temperature of around 10 degrees Celsius. The area had lots of trees, particularly conifers, cycads and tree ferns. Sinosauropteryx lived alongside several other Chinese dinosaurs, including the feathered tyrannosaur Yutyrannus, the long-clawed Beipiaosaurus and the parrot-beaked Psittacosaurus.What colour was Sinosauropteryx?From studying the traces of pigments left in fossils, scientists have discovered that Sinosauropteryx was mostly a red-brown colour with alternating dark and light bands on its tail. These bands would have helped to camouflage the little dinosaur - kind of like zebra stripes. It may also have had a light-coloured stomach. This type of colour pattern - darker on top and lighter underneath - is called countershading. It's common in many animals today. Countershading makes it so that the shadows on the animal's underside don't look as dark. It helps the creature blend into the background and be less obvious to would-be predators.",

    "found_in": "Egypt, MoroccoSpinosaurus was a large meat-eating dinosaur from Africa. Scientists think it may have lived a semi-aquatic lifestyle.Our understanding of Spinosaurus has changed in recent years. For over 100 years we only had very incomplete remains of this dinosaur. Plus, the few bones from the first discovery in 1912 were accidentally destroyed during the Second World War.What did Spinosaurus look like?For most of the last century scientists reconstructed Spinosaurus as a completely land-based animal with long hind legs, like Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus.We now know that Spinosaurus had quite short legs and may have spent a lot of its time living in and around water. It also had a wide, paddle-like tail.It isn't clear whether this dinosaur swam a lot, or mostly lived on the shoreline.What did Spinosaurus eat?We know from the shape of the dinosaur's jaws that it fed on fish, although it may have eaten other dinosaurs too.Like other members of the spinosaur group, Spinosaurus had a narrow snout and a distinctive notch near the front of its jaws. This would have been very effective at trapping fish.Why did Spinosaurus have a sail?There are several theories about the impressive 1.5-metre-high sail on Spinosaurus' back.It may have helped to regulate the animal's body temperature or been part of an elaborate mating display.The sail may even have helped to propel the dinosaur through water.Some scientists have speculated that Spinosaurus had a thick, fleshy hump rather than a thin sail. But the latest research suggests that a thin sail is most likely.When did Spinosaurus live?Spinosaurus lived between 99 and 93.5 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous Period. At that time, its North African habitat consisted of tidal flats (muddy or marshy areas that get covered by the sea) and mangrove forests.The hottest time of year would bring long droughts, which would cause many lakes and rivers to dry up. This may have forced Spinosaurus to sometimes act as a land predator.Was Spinosaurus bigger than Tyrannosaurus?At 14 metres (46 feet) long from nose to tail, Spinosaurus was longer than any other carnivorous dinosaur known to science. But we don't have any complete skeletons, so the full length is just an estimate.However, Spinosaurus' short hind legs meant that T. rex stood taller at the hips.Did Spinosaurus walk on all fours?Our understanding of how Spinosaurus walked has changed over the years.Some reconstructions of Spinosaurus show it walking on all fours, while many scientists today believe that it was able to walk on two legs. It's still not clear who is right, and we may need to wait for new discoveries or studies to find out more.",

After finding a specimen that had been covered with mud, which had held the plates in place, Marsh realised that they stood vertically, alternately on either side of the spine.Scientists are not exactly sure what the plates were used for. They may have warned off predators, or allowed members of the same species to recognise each other. Another suggestion is that the plates were used to regulate body temperature.There are tiny grooves in the plate surfaces, possibly where blood vessels would have been. The amount of blood passing through these vessels would determine the amount of heat transfer.Compared with the rest of its body, Stegosaurus had a small head and its brain was around the size of a plum!A star specimenAn almost complete Stegosaurus skeleton went on display in our Earth Hall in December 2014.Identified as a member of the species Stegosaurus stenops, this spectacular specimen is helping researchers gain new insights into what Stegosaurus would have looked like when it was alive, as well as how it walked, ate and behaved.",

    "found_in": "CanadaStenonychosaurus is a small, two-legged dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous Period of Canada. There are also some remains from Montana, USA, that might be Stenonychosaurus.For a long time, scientists thought the Stenonychosaurus fossils belonged to a related dinosaur, Troodon. But now we know most of what we used to call Troodon was actually Stenonychosaurus.This dinosaur resembled a big version of a modern bird. It laid eggs in nests in the same way birds do today.Its back legs were very long, suggesting that it could run quickly.How smart was Stenonychosaurus?Experts think Stenonychosaurus might have been quite intelligent by dinosaur standards. We can see from its skull that its brain was very large relative to its body size.But although it was probably cleverer than most other dinosaurs, it wouldn't have been anywhere near as smart as a human.In fact, it's likely that the most intelligent birds alive today, such as crows, are smarter than Stenonychosaurus.What did Stenonychosaurus eat?Stenonychosaurus had good eyesight and hooked toe claws. So, we think it preyed on other animals. But its teeth are unusual compared to other meat-eating dinosaurs.A lot of carnivorous dinosaurs had teeth with serrations - tiny saw-like edges along the sides of the teeth.Most carnivores have very small serrations to help with cutting through flesh, but the serrations on Stenonychosaurus teeth are large. It's possible this helped Stenonychosaurus bite through tough plant material.For this reason, some scientists think Stenonychosaurus was an omnivore - an animal that eats both meat and vegetation.Stenonychosaurus vs TroodonIn recent years, researchers realised that a lot of the fossils they'd been calling Troodon really belonged to Stenonychosaurus.This means most of what we used to think was true about Troodon is actually true for Stenonychosaurus.Today, the only fossils we have for Troodon are some teeth. So, we don't know much about this dinosaur.Some scientists think we should stop using the name Troodon altogether. They say the teeth aren't enough to justify a unique name and they might even turn out to belong to another already named dinosaur.We'll have to wait for more research or new fossil finds to know for sure.",

    "period": "Late Cretaceous",
    "found_in": "Canada, USAStyracosaurus was a plant-eating dinosaur with a striking arrangement of long spikes around its neck frill and a massive horn on its nose.We think these spikes may have been used to defend against predators because it probably couldn't outrun them. This dinosaur walked on four legs and was almost certainly very slow.Experts think Styracosaurus - like many other horned dinosaurs - was probably a herd animal. The discovery of several Styracosaurus specimens together in one bone bed suggests they lived and died together.Styracosaurus vs TriceratopsStyracosaurus and Triceratops were both ceratopsid dinosaurs, which all had neck frills and facial horns.There were two types of ceratopsids - centrosaurines and chasmosaurines.Styracosaurus was a centrosaurine, with a long nose horn and no brow horns. Triceratops was a chasmosaurine - these dinosaurs tended to have short nose horns and prominent brow horns.How big was Styracosaurus?At 5.5 metres long and 2,700 kilogrammes in weight, Styracosaurus was a hefty animal. But some of its relatives were much larger.Other ceratopsid dinosaurs such as Pentaceratops and Torosaurus could reach much bigger sizes. It's hard to say for sure, but the largest ceratopsid might have been Triceratops, at around nine metres long.Where and when was Styracosaurus discovered?The first ever Styracosaurus fossils were found in 1913 at a location in Alberta, Canada. Today, it's known as Dinosaur Provincial Park.This world-famous fossil site has UNESCO World Heritage status due to the large numbers of high-quality dinosaur remains found there.In 1915, an American fossil-hunting group visited the park and found another Styracosaurus skeleton. This one was almost complete.Then in 1935, a group of Canadian scientists revisited the site of the original Styracosaurus find and came across even more fossils.How many horns did Styracosaurus have?The number of long horns around Styracosaurus' frill seems to have varied between individuals.Some Styracosaurus skulls show six long frill spikes, whereas others show eight. Additional smaller bumps and knobs were present around the back edge of the frill of some Styracosaurus individuals, but not all.What did Styracosaurus eat?Styracosaurus was a plant-eating dinosaur. It had a parrot-like beak, as well as rows of teeth that were continuously replaced - ideal for feeding on tough material. The downward angle of its head and mouth probably meant it mostly ate low-growing vegetation.It's possible Styracosaurus used its horns and beak to knock down taller plants to make them easier to reach.What hunted Styracosaurus?Despite being a reasonable size with fearsome-looking horns, Styracosaurus would have been prey for large meat-eating dinosaurs.We don't have any direct evidence of a particular carnivore attacking Styracosaurus. But we know Styracosaurus lived alongside some very big predators, such as Daspletosaurus. This relative of Tyrannosaurus would have had the size and strength to take on a multi-horned ceratopsid.",

    "found_in": "MongoliaTarchia was an ankylosaur, a heavily armoured type of dinosaur. Like many ankylosaurs, Tarchia sported a hard, bony club on the end of its tail. Experts have debated whether the club was used for defending against predators, for fighting other Tarchia or both.In 2021, a new Tarchia specimen was discovered with impact damage to the tail and hips. This suggests that it may have been hit by the tail club of another ankylosaur.What does Tarchia mean?The name Tarchia comes from the Mongolian word 'tarkhi', meaning 'brain'.Teresa Maryanska, a Polish scientist who specialised in Mongolian dinosaurs, chose this name because the dinosaur had a larger braincase than its close relative Saichania.Ankylosaurs assemble!Tarchia and Saichania - plus a third ankylosaur called Zaraapelta - all lived together in what is now the Gobi Desert. Although the Mongolian desert today is mostly rocks, in the Cretaceous Period it was a sandy expanse with dunes and oases. Tarchia's mouth shape suggests that it was probably quite selective about the types of ground-level plants it ate. Earlier ankylosaurs tended to eat many different types of plants in bulk.Tarchia vs TarbosaurusTarchia also lived alongside Tarbosaurus, a meat-eating dinosaur closely related to Tyrannosaurus.Tarbosaurus tooth marks have been found on a Tarchia skull, showing that the ankylosaur was hunted by the giant predator.",

    "name": "Torvosaurus",

    "type": "large theropod",
    "length": "10.0m",
    "diet": "carnivorous",
    "period": "Late Jurassic",
    "found_in": "Germany, Portugal, USATorvosaurus was one of the largest meat-eating dinosaurs of the Jurassic Period.It was closely related to Megalosaurus â the first officially named dinosaur. Torvosaurus remains have been found in multiple countries around the world â in both North America and Europe and possibly Africa and South America too. There are currently two named species of Torvosaurus. One of these, Torvosaurus gurneyi, is named after James Gurney, the creator of the Dinotopia book series.Torvosaurus fossils from Germany may represent a third species, but this hasnât yet been given a name. When was Torvosaurus found?The name Torvosaurus was coined in 1979 when fossil hunters found bones in Colorado, USA.In the following years, experts realised that some earlier bone discoveries from other places also belonged to Torvosaurus.It turned out the first ever Torvosaurus fossils had been found way back in 1899. But theyâd sat unnamed and forgotten in a museum collection until somebody rediscovered them in 2010.In recent years, Torvosaurus bones have also been unearthed in Portugal and Germany. There are also fossils from Tanzania, Uruguay, Spain and England that some scientists think are Torvosaurus. The most complete Torvosaurus skeleton ever found came from Colorado in 2012. Researchers nicknamed this individual Elvis.But even though Elvis is the best Torvosaurus specimen found so far, it still has lots of pieces missing. In fact, we only have 55% of the skeleton. How did Torvosaurus hunt?We know Torvosaurus lived alongside some other big carnivores like Allosaurus, Saurophaganax and Ceratosaurus. Scientists think Torvosaurus may have had a different hunting style to these dinosaurs, although they all preyed on plant-eating dinosaurs. Allosaurus had long legs and might have preferred hunting on open plains, where it could run quickly without anything getting in the way. The lower body of Torvosaurus was more suited to slowly stalking prey across rivers and forests. Perhaps Torvosaurus or Ceratosaurus even tucked into Allosaurus occasionally. An Allosaurus hip bone was found with tooth marks that might be from Torvosaurus, although itâs hard to be sure. Was Torvosaurus related to Tyrannosaurus?While Torvosaurus and Tyrannosaurus were both large, meat-eating dinosaurs and looked quite similar, they werenât closely related. Torvosaurus belonged to the megalosaur dinosaur group and lived during the Jurassic Period. In contrast, Tyrannosaurus lived tens of millions of years later during the Cretaceous Period and was part of the coelurosaur group.",

    "name": "Triceratops",
    "pronunciation": "tri-SERRA-tops",
    "meaning": "three-horned face",
    "type": "ceratopsian",
    "length": "9.0mWeight:10000kg",
    "diet": "herbivorousTeeth: horny beak and shearing teethFood:tough palm frondsHow it moved: on 4 legs",
    "period": "Late Cretaceous",
    "found_in": "USAWith its three horns, parrot-like beak and large frill that could reach nearly one metre across, the skull of Triceratops is one of the largest and most striking of any land animal.Triceratops might have used its horns to fend off attacks from Tyrannosaurus. A partial Triceratops fossil collected in 1997 has a horn that was bitten off, with bite marks that match Tyrannosaurus. The fossil shows that the horn healed after being bitten, indicating that at least some Triceratops survived these encounters.Puncture marks on fossil frills show that male Triceratops also used their horns to fight each other, probably to impress females.Skin impressions have been found for Triceratops, showing that it had large, pebbled scales.Did Triceratops live in herds?We know many other horned dinosaur species lived in herds because weâve found fossils of many different individuals of the same species at the same location.By moving in herds, prey animals can warn each other of danger and lessen their chances of being singled out by a predator.However, Triceratops was unusual in this respect, as their remains are usually found individually, which suggests that they may have spent much of their lives alone.Why did Triceratops have a frill?Triceratopsâ frill might have helped to protect its neck, but some specimens show Tyrannosaurus bite marks puncturing the frill, so it wasnât always enough.The frills could also have been used to attract mates or as a way for members of the same species to recognise each other.When was Triceratops first discovered?Triceratops was originally discovered in 1887 by the American scientist Othniel Charles Marsh. His first find was a pair of horn cores.Horn cores are the bony inner part of the dinosaurâs horns, which in life would have been covered in keratin â the same stuff our hair and fingernails are made of. This keratin would have made the horns longer and sharper in life than the fossils might suggest.To begin with, Othniel thought the horn cores belonged to a giant bison, so he called his find Bison alticornis.But it wasnât long before more remains were unearthed, showing more of the animal. Othniel eventually realised the cores belonged to a three-horned dinosaur, which he called Triceratops.In the years that followed, fossil hunters found more Triceratops skulls in a variety of shapes and sizes. This made scientists think there could be lots of different species of Triceratops. Today, we think there were only two species â Triceratops horridus and Triceratops prorsus. The wide variety of skulls probably just means individual Triceratops could look quite different from one another.What did Triceratops eat?Triceratops was a herbivore â a plant eater.It had a sharp beak to snip and clip vegetation and rows of teeth at the back of its jaws that formed shearing surfaces for grinding up tough plant material.Triceratops probably ate low-growing plants, but its ability to raise its head also suggests it could reach slightly higher vegetation.It may have used its frill and horns to push through dense plant growth or to defend itself while feeding.Was Triceratops related to rhinoceroses?Triceratops wasnât related to rhinoceroses at all. Apart from the visual similarity of the nose horn and bulky body, these two creatures belong to totally different groups of animals.Triceratops was a dinosaur, whereas rhinoceroses are mammals.The mammal family tree stretches back a long way. The earliest true mammals â the ancestors of modern rhinos â were around in the Late Triassic Period, about 225â210 million years ago. They evolved alongside dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures and were well established by the time Triceratops appeared 68 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous.Sometimes when two unrelated animals happen to have similar lifestyles or face similar challenges, they can evolve along the same lines and end up looking a bit like each other. Scientists call this convergent evolution.Another example is bats and birds â they arenât related but both have wings. Bats evolved their wings separately, which is also why they look a little different to those of birds, being skin covered rather than feathered.",

Scientists have recently reclassified many of the known fossils. Most of what we used to call Troodon is now Stenonychosaurus.The question remains whether we should still consider Troodon a distinct dinosaur. If so, it lived in the Late Cretaceous Period in what is now North America.Is Troodon still a valid dinosaur name?Experts are still debating whether Troodon should be a proper dinosaur name. The only fossils currently known as Troodon are some teeth. Many scientists think these teeth aren't enough by themselves to justify a separate dinosaur name. It may turn out that they belonged to another dinosaur.Hopefully future research and more fossil discoveries will clarify whether we should continue to use the name Troodon - and if so, what this dinosaur was really like.Why did the Troodon fossils get reclassified?Historically, dinosaur researchers have treated the name Troodon as a 'wastebasket taxon'.A wastebasket taxon is a scientific term that gets used as a catch-all for all sorts of potentially unrelated things. This includes finds people don't know how else to classify.This means a lot of fossil remains have been called Troodon over the years, sometimes wrongly.Modern studies have helped to sort out the confusion. Scientists worked out that many of the bones people had been calling Troodon really belonged to another dinosaur called Stenonychosaurus and possibly some others.These days, the only remains we still call Troodon fossils are the original teeth found in 1856.Was Troodon a carnivore?The teeth of Troodon and its relatives are quite unusual.Although Troodon had serrated teeth like the meat-eating dinosaurs it's related to, its tooth shape is a lot like that of some plant-eating animals.So, experts think Troodon may have been omnivorous, meaning it ate a mixed diet of both meat and vegetation.How smart was Troodon?Until recently, scientists said Troodon might have been one of the most intelligent dinosaurs.This was because of its large braincase. But the skull from this study is now identified as belonging to Stenonychosaurus.This means we don't really know what Troodon's brain was like.Was Troodon a raptor?Troodon wasn't a dromaeosaur - the group popularly called raptors that includes the well-known dinosaur Velociraptor.

    "period": "Early Cretaceous",
    "found_in": "USAUtahraptor was a meat-eating dinosaur that lived in what's now North America.It was a member of the dromaeosaur group, like Velociraptor. But Utahraptor was much larger, the largest known member of this group.It was much stockier than many of its relatives. Some other dromaeosaurs were very small and slim.Who discovered Utahraptor?The American scientist Jim Jensen found the first Utahraptor remains in 1975. But the dinosaur wasn't studied in detail until 1991, when another group of researchers - James Kirkland, Robert Gaston and Donald Burge - found more fossils. As the dinosaur's name suggests, all the known fossils come from Utah in the USA. The species name, ostrommaysi, is a mash-up of two names. It jointly honours John Ostrom - a renowned dinosaur scientist, and Chris Mays - a special effects expert who helped raise money for Utahraptor research. James Kirkland considered naming the species after Jurassic Park film director Steven Spielberg, in the hope that Spielberg's production company would help to fund the research project. But the deal never got off the ground and Kirkland ultimately changed his mind. About eight years after Utahraptor ostrommaysi was named, another scientist adjusted it to ostrommaysorum. But because of the rules on how animal species are named, this was wrong and scientists say ostrommaysi should be used.How big was Utahraptor?At 5.5 metres long, Utahraptor was a very large dromaeosaur. Whereas its smaller relatives such as Velociraptor and Bambiraptor were slender and agile, Utahraptor was a heavy, bulky animal.But it wasn't the only big dromaeosaur. Achillobator, Austroraptor and Dakotaraptor also reached large sizes.Was Utahraptor intelligent?In popular culture, dromaeosaurs - often known as 'raptors' - have a reputation for intelligence. Jurassic Park shows Velociraptor as smart enough to solve puzzles and open doors. In reality, Utahraptor and its relatives may have been a little bit cleverer than other dinosaurs, but not much. They had slightly larger brains relative to their body size, but this isn't a very reliable way to predict intelligence. A large brain may mean an animal is clever, or it may mean that it has very good vision or hearing. Brainpower can be as important for these senses as the eyes and ears.Most modern birds probably have a more developed brain than Utahraptor. But nobody knows for sure.How fast was Utahraptor?Scientists think it's unlikely that Utahraptor was very fast. It may have used an ambush style of hunting.Although smaller dromaeosaurs would have been very agile, Utahraptor probably wasn't very good at jumping or pouncing, as it was so much bigger and heavier.Did Utahraptor have feathers?We don't have any direct fossil evidence that Utahraptor had feathers. However, it seems likely that all dromaeosaurs were covered in feathers. So, Utahraptor almost certainly had them too.Utahraptor in popular cultureA female Utahraptor was the main character of Robert Bakker's 1995 novel, Raptor Red. Set in the Cretaceous Period, the book mixes science and make-believe to describe the trials and tribulations of one dinosaur as she and her pack try to survive and look after their young. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Utahraptor is also the state dinosaur of Utah. This honour was given after a 10-year-old student petitioned the Utah Senate in 2018 to replace Allosaurus as the state fossil. The senators decided to keep Allosaurus as the official fossil, but they were so impressed by the proposal they added a new state symbol - the state dinosaur - for Utahraptor.",

    "period": "Early Cretaceous",
    "found_in": "ChinaYutyrannus was a large, meat-eating dinosaur from northern China. It was an early member of the tyrannosaur group.Unlike later tyrannosaurs, which had short arms with two-fingered hands, Yutyrannus had three fingers on each hand and longer arms.Yutyrannus had a shallow crest along the top of its head and two short horns near its eyes.Fearsome and featheredMany fossilised feather impressions were discovered along with this dinosaur's bones. Yutyrannus is the biggest dinosaur that we're certain had feathers.We don't know if Yutyrannus was completely covered in feathers. Experts have found multiple feather impressions from around the dinosaur's body - so it seems likely.Many experts say that Yutyrannus' feathers mean that later related dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus rex, probably had feathers too. But nobody knows for sure.Researchers have found some scaly skin impressions for T. rex, but it may have had some feathers too, at least when young.What does Yutyrannus mean?The name Yutyrannus comes from the Mandarin Chinese word 'yu' for feathers and the Latin word 'tyrannus', meaning tyrant or king.The species name huali comes from the Mandarin for beautiful - the dinosaur's plumage impressed the researchers who named it.How big was Yutyrannus?Three Yutyrannus skeletons have been discovered. The two smaller specimens are almost complete.This means scientists can estimate the fully grown length of Yutyrannus with confidence. We think it was around 7.5 metres long.While quite large, this is nowhere close to Tyrannosaurus, which could grow to more than 12 metres in length.Where did Yutyrannus live?Scientists couldn't collect the Yutyrannus specimens themselves. They got them from a fossil dealer who said they were from a quarry in Liaoning, China.As researchers don't know exactly where the remains were found, nobody is certain what kind of environment the dinosaur lived in or what other dinosaurs were there too.The most likely theory is that Yutyrannus lived in an area with a lot of trees, lakes, regular volcanic activity and forest fires. Despite the volcanoes, the area was probably quite cool - around 10 degrees Celsius. This might explain the need for a feather coat!Since the three Yutyrannus specimens were found together, some experts think the dinosaur might have been a pack hunter that teamed up to take down bigger dinosaurs such as long-necked sauropods.",
